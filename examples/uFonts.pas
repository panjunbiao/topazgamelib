    United States including, but not limited to, export control laws.
    Customer acknowledges that the Software remains proprietary and
    confidential information and intellectual property of the Company and/or
    its suppliers and therefore Customer agrees not to modify the Software or
    attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the
    Software, except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such
    restriction. Reproduction and/or redistribution of any portion of the
    Software is specifically prohibited without the Company's prior written
    permission.

11. Any Party may terminate the Term of this Agreement effective upon written
    notice to the other Parties if any other Party materially breaches any of
    such Party's obligations under this Agreement, and that Party has not
    cured the breach within thirty (30) days after notice of the breach from
    the non-breaching Party. However, in case of termination, Sections 5
    through 10 of this Agreement shall indefinitely survive its termination.
    This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
    laws of the State of Florida with exclusive venue in courts located in

    trademarks and patents, by U.S. federal law. This License sets forth the

    FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY THAN CUSTOMER. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY WHERE
    THE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. FURTHERMORE, SOME STATES DO
    NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.

13. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not
    designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control
    equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such
    as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or
    communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines,
    or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Software could lead
    directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
    damage ("High Risk Activities"). The Company and its suppliers
    specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High
    Risk Activities.
